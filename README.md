# COSMWASM Execution Layer

This is the implementation of the Cosmos SDK module `x/wasm` which allows you to upload and execute WebAssembly (wasm) bytecode on a Cosmos chain.

 This repository hosts `Wasmd`, the first implementation of a cosmos zone with wasm smart contracts enabled.

This is fork of the Wasmd repository
